The Wireless Transmitter is used to send signals to wireless network items in Refined Storage.

Keep in mind that you have to place the Wireless Transmitter on a [[Cable]].

## Range
The default range is 16 blocks, but can be upgraded with [[Range Upgrade|range upgrades]].

## Placing transmitters efficiently
Placing 2 Wireless Transmitters just next to each other will not do that much.

The wireless signal starts from the Wireless Transmitter's position, so, if you place 2 transmitters next to each other you'll only have a net gain of 1 block.

Instead, you have to spread your wireless transmitters around.

## Applicable upgrades
- [[Range Upgrade]]
