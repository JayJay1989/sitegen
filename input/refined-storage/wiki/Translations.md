## How to create a translation
Copy https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/blob/mc1.11/src/main/resources/assets/refinedstorage/lang/en_US.lang to a text file on your computer and replace the text after the `=` in the language of your translation.

## How to submit your translation
- If you know Git good enough, you can contribute new languages files via a pull request
- If you do not know how to use Git / Github,  upload the translation file to Pastebin or Gist [and send it to me through an GitHub issue](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/issues)

## Updating existing translations
You can compare the new and removed translations keys yourself, [or use a Perl script I wrote](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/blob/mc1.11/translation-diff.pl) that outputs a diff between `en_US` and the version specified.

You can of course always diff manually using another tool, like the `diff` utility or an online diffing tool.
