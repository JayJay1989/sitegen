Refined Storage has development builds available for unreleased versions.

Simply go to [our Jenkins](https://jenkins.raoulvdberge.com/), select the mod you want for the correct MC version and choose the latest build. You want the build in the form of `refinedstorage-{unreleased version}+{build-number}.jar`.

Then, replace the old Refined Storage jar with the development build one in your modded instance.

Don't forget to update Refined Storage dependencies as well, like addons and Refined Storage Addons (also available [on Jenkins](https://jenkins.raoulvdberge.com/)) or you might get crashes!

**IMPORTANT:** Using development builds is a risk. It may contain untested code, bugs and crashes. Remember to take backups.
