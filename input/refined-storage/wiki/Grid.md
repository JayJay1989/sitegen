The Grid is a block that allows access to the items and fluids in the storage network.

The player can extract items or fluids from the central GUI.

## Sorting
The items or fluids in a Grid can be sorted in various ways:

- By name
- By quantity
- By item ID
- Last modified
- InventoryTweaks sorting (only available if InventoryTweaks is installed)

The sorting direction can also be chosen (ascending or descending).

## Filter
In the sidebar of the Grid there are slots where the player can insert [[Filter|filters]] to filter certain items in the Grid.

### Tabs
A Grid can also have tabs. When clicking on the tab, only items configured in the [[Filter]] are visible.

To use tabs in the Grid, make a [[Filter]] with an icon specified.

To have more than 4 tabs, put a [[Filter]] in a [[Filter]].

## Sizes
The size of any Grid can be configured as well:

- Stretched (default)
- Small
- Medium
- Large

When choosing the stretched size, the Grid will take up all the vertical screen space. This can be limited through the `maxRowsStretch` config option.

## Controls
|Type|Description|
|----|-------|
|Left click|Takes at most 64 items|
|Right click|Takes at most 32 items|
|Middle click|Takes 1 item|
|SHIFT|Pushes the items to the player's inventory|
|SHIFT + CTRL|Forces the crafting window to open even if the item is available|
|CTRL + X|Clears crafting matrix|
|Right click on search bar|Clears the search query|
|Tab|Selects the search bar when the Grid isn't in autoselection mode|
|When in the crafting start GUI, pressing SHIFT|Skips the crafting preview window|

These controls can be combined. For example, pressing SHIFT and middle click at the same time will push 1 item to the player inventory.

## Display
The Grid can be configured to only show craftable items or only non-craftable items.

By default, the tooltips for items in a Grid are a little bit bigger to display the total item count and the last modified information. This can be turned off by using the `detailedTooltip` config option.

By default, the Grid uses a small font size to display item or fluid quantities. Use the `largeFont` config option to change this.
