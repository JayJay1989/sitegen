The Crafting Grid is the same as a regular [[Grid]], but has a crafting inventory.

When an item is crafted, it won't just clear the crafting slots, but it'll try to retrieve the same items from the storage network again.

## Recipe transferring

The Crafting Grid integrates with [JEI (Just Enough Items)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei) so the player can use recipe transferring.
